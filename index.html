    <h3 class="section-title">About Me</h3>

    <p>
      I am a technology-focused professional with a strong foundation in networking,
      Linux systems, hardware, and enterprise-level operating environments. My experience
      spans multiple sectors and platforms, where I have worked with system administration,
      network fundamentals, and infrastructure concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have hands-on exposure to Linux file management, server configuration, access control,
      troubleshooting, and Windows server environments. My background in networking includes
      LAN concepts, TCP/IP fundamentals, routing, switching, and wireless technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside traditional systems and networks, I actively explore AI, automation, and
      emerging technologies. I focus on understanding how systems work at a deeper level
      rather than chasing shortcuts or trends.
    </p>

    <p>
      I do not actively take on random client work. I collaborate selectively, prioritizing
      clarity, experimentation, and long-term value while building a strong personal brand.
